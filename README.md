## Personnal projects

I made 3 apps publicly available that you can find on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5773474916640770322).


#### ZPuzzle

![ZPuzzle](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qnNYOKDi7pCpU3tpdWqOSaPfX2W3s0GLV0yivXW4rmbFQHgraDSCAggXpXijjhbBuPM=s360-rw)

You can find this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/apalala-dev/zpuzzle). I was [one of the winners of the Flutter Puzzle Hack](https://devpost.com/software/zpuzzle) thanks to this project.

You may also be interested in the package I made for this hackathon: [zwidget](https://pub.dev/packages/zwidget).

It simulates 3D by overlapping the same widget several times and applying transforms to them.

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/apalala-dev/zwidget).

#### HexaBoard

![HexaBoard](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2GqoYySqtbH6BFE2S3quFo2wFG_9Ol5-R-22uFku7GDuQq0z5frhQfrUCpGoX2lKNB0=s360-rw)

This game has been done fully with Flutter.

Among the interesting parts, there are AI, animations and online capabilities.

Find the app on Google Play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalala.hexagon).

#### ApalalaParty

![Apalala Party](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ruz_UI_Ddw-zs7x8UVWO6ZcfigpMW6Bf1GCPXkeOjYNqwS6x5m6V0GzppaRV5-tjBD4=s360-rw)

A party game that I developed to learn more about Flutter. In fact, there are several minigames inside that you can play with buddies on the same phone.
Unfortunately, I worked on that particular app during the Covid lockdowns, which is not ideal for an app played on the same phone.
